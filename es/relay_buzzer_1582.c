When we need more than one relays, using transistors and diodes become bulky. In these cases we can use ULN drivers. These are monolithic IC s consists of High Voltage High Current Darlington transistor arrays. When using these driver ICs we donâ€™t need to connect freewheeling diode as they have built in clamp diodes. Here we are using ULN2003 for demostration.
